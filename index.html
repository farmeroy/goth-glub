          Life in this society being, at best, an utter bore and no aspect of
          society being at all relevant to goths and weirdos, there remains to
          thrill-seeking freaks that are left- only to overthrow the government,
          eliminate the money system, institute complete automation and destroy
          the music industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is now technically feasible to reproduce songs and videos without
          the aid of corporate music overlords. We must begin immediately to do
          so. To be mainstream is to be deficient, emotionally limited; all
          pop-stars are emotional cripples.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>GOTH CLUB</span> is impatient; <span>GOTH CLUB</span> is not
          consoled by the thought that future generations will one day hear its
          sound; <span>GOTH CLUB</span> wants to grab some thrilling living for
          itself. And, if a large majority of weirdos had access to
          <span>GOTH CLUB</span>, they could acquire complete control of this
          country within a few weeks simply by blasting
          <span>GOTH CLUB</span> from every window, thereby paralyzing the
          entire nation. Additional measures, any one of which would be
          sufficient to completely disrupt the economy and everything else,
          would be for their fans to declare themselves off the money system,
          stop buying, just loot and simply refuse to obey all laws they don't
          care to obey.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unhampered by propriety, niceness, discretion, public opinion,
          `morals', the respect of assholes, always dark, dirty, low-down...
          <span>GOTH CLUB</span> gets around... and around and around... they've
          seen the whole show -- every bit of it -- the fucking scenes; the punk
          scene -- they've covered the whole cemetery, been under and around
          every tombstone and grave -- ravers, squatters, swingers...
          <span>GOTH CLUB</span> has been through it all, and they're now ready
          for a new show; they want to crawl out from their coffins, take
          flight, glamorize.... sink their fangs in.

            <span>Goth Club</span> are a synth-punk duo that was born out of the
            dystopian nightmare that was 2020. They divide themselves between
            Berlin and Istanbul and are of American/French/British origins. With
            shimmering synth-pop sounds that sustain a driving post-punk guitar
            under often ominous lyrics, <span>Goth Club</span> are the vital
            antidote to these toxic times.
